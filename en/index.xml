      <description>As mentioned above, for a long time, until the Seito 19th Headmaster, the style of Muso Jikiden Eishin-ryu was passed on down the generations without leaving Tosa Province, but at the start of the Showa Era (1926), the Osaka branch of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai association, recognizing the true value and importance of iaido, advocated its practice along with kendo and judo.

      <description>Precepts of Master Kōno Hyakuren, 20 th Head of the Musō-jikiden Eishin-ryu School of Iaido
 
I sincerely hope that those who seek to learn the teachings of this school will maintain throughout their training a firm resolution to correctly transmit to later practitioners the forms of our school that former masters have handed down from ancient times to the present day, absolutely uncolored by personal philosophy and in no way altered.</description>
