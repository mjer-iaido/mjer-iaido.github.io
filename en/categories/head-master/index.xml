      <description>As mentioned above, for a long time, until the Seito 19th Headmaster, the style of Muso Jikiden Eishin-ryu was passed on down the generations without leaving Tosa Province, but at the start of the Showa Era (1926), the Osaka branch of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai association, recognizing the true value and importance of iaido, advocated its practice along with kendo and judo. From then, the Headmaster was invited from Kochi Prefecture each year, and for around 20 years, he held training sessions that were a great success, with around 20,000 people taking part.</description>
